                                To use the service on the Website, we may ask you to enter information about your age, gender, email address, current financial situation and ask other onboarding questions. We also automatically collect from your
                                device: language settings, IP address, time zone, type and model of a device, device settings, operating system. We need this data to provide our services, analyze how our customers use the service and to measure ads.

                                For improving our service and serving ads, we use third party solutions. As a result, we may process data using solutions developed by Amazon Web Services, Facebook, Google, TikTok, Hotjar, Amplitude, Apple, PayPal,
                                FreshDesk, Solidgate, ActiveCampaign. Therefore, some of the data is stored and processed on servers of such third parties. This enables us to: (1) analyze different interactions (how often users make subscriptions, what
                                is the most popular users’ financial goal, what is the average time spent by users on the service); (2) serve ads (and are able to show them only to a particular group users, for example, to subscribers). Consequently,
                                we, in particular, better understand in what of our features and content you see the most value and are able to focus on them to enhance your experience and increase the quality of our products.
